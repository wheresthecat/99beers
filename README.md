# 99 beers

I don't like beer, but I kinda like programming, so I've decided to make my
own versions of beers songs in other languages. My plan is to try as many
programming languages as I'll be able to mentally process, but please 
bear with me. I'm not a rocket scientist, but self-studying pleb.

So I will be adding more languages and maybe correcting some typos and stupid
mistakes.

Have a nice day, folks.
